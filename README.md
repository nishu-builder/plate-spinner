# Plate-Spinner

Dashboard for managing multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv tool install .
sp install              # Install hooks, prints config to add to ~/.claude/settings.json
sp run                  # Start tracked session (terminal 1)
sp run                  # Start another (terminal 2)
sp                      # Open dashboard (terminal 3)
```

## Usage

**Dashboard** (`sp`): Shows all sessions in two groups:
- **OPEN**: Active sessions, sorted with "needs attention" first
- **CLOSED**: Sessions that have exited

Keybindings:
- `1-9` - Jump to session and resume
- `up/down` - Navigate sessions
- `enter` - Resume selected session
- `delete` - Dismiss selected session
- `c` - Toggle closed/open
- `s` - Sound settings
- `r` - Refresh
- `q` - Quit

## Session States

| Icon | Status | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.` | starting | Session registered, no activity yet |
| `>` | running | Tool executing |
| `?` | awaiting_input | `AskUserQuestion` called |
| `!` | awaiting_approval | `ExitPlanMode` called |
| `-` | idle | Stop event received |
| `X` | error | Stop event with error |
| `x` | closed | Session wrapper exited |

AI summaries appear when sessions reach a waiting state (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

The dashboard shows warnings if hooks are outdated or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set.

## Commands

```
sp              Dashboard (auto-starts daemon)
sp run [args]   Launch Claude with tracking
sp install      Install/update hooks, print settings config
sp kill         Stop daemon
sp sessions     List sessions as JSON
sp daemon       Run daemon in foreground
sp config       Manage configuration
  path          Print config file path
  export        Export config to stdout
  import <file> Import config from file
```

## Architecture

```
Claude Code (sp run)
    | hooks on tool calls
    v
~/.plate-spinner/hooks/*.sh
    | POST localhost:7890
    v
Daemon (SQLite + WebSocket) --> TUI
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Claude Code
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional, enables summaries)
